## Analysis Techniques

### Static Analysis

### Dynamic Analysis

#### Runtime Analysis
(.. TODO ..)

#### Traffic Analysis

Dynamic analysis of the traffic exchanged between client and server can be performed by launching a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can be achieved by using an interception proxy like Burp Suite (Professional) or OWASP ZAP for HTTP traffic.  

* [Configuring an Android Device to work with Burp](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841101-configuring-an-android-device-to-work-with-burp)
* [Configuring an iOS Device to work with Burp](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp)

In case another (proprietary) protocol is used in a mobile App that is not HTTP, the following tools can be used to try to intercept or analyze the traffic:

* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

#### Input Fuzzing
Fuzz testing, is a method for testing software input validation by feeding it intentionally malformed input.
Steps in fuzzing
* Identifying a target
* Generating malicious inputs
* Test case delivery
* Crash monitoring

## Tampering and Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering and tampering techniques have long belonged to the realm of crackers, modders, malware analysts, and other more exotic professions. For "traditional" security testers and researchers, reverse engineering has been more of a complementary, nice-to-have-type skill that wasn't all that useful in 99% of day-to-day work. But the tides are turning: Mobile app black-box testing increasingly requires testers to disassemble compiled apps, apply patches, and tamper with binary code or even live processes. The fact that many mobile apps implement defenses against unwelcome tampering doesn't make things easier for us.

Mobile security testers should be able to understand basic reverse engineering concepts. It goes without saying that they should also know mobile devices and operating systems inside out: The processor architecture, executable format, programming language intricacies, and so forth.

Reverse engineering is an art, and describing every available facet of it would fill a whole library. The sheer range of techniques and possible specializations is mind-blowing: One can spend years working on a very specific, isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or developing novel de-obfuscation methods. Security testers are generalists: To be effective reverse engineers, they must be able to filter through the vast amount of information to build a workable methodology.

There is no generic reverse engineering process that always works. That said, we'll describe commonly used methods and tools later on, and give examples for tackling the most common defenses.

### Why You Need It

Mobile security testing requires at least basic reverse engineering skills for several reasons:

**1. To enable black-box testing of mobile apps.** Modern apps often employ technical controls that will hinder your ability to perform dynamic analysis. SSL pinning and E2E encryption could prevent you from intercepting or manipulating traffic with a proxy. Root detection could prevent the app from running on a rooted device, preventing you from using advanced testing tools. In this cases, you must be able to deactivate these defenses.

**2. To enhance static analysis in black-box security testing.** In a black-box test, static analysis of the app bytecode or binary code is helpful for getting a better understanding of what the app is doing. It also enables you to identify certain flaws, such as credentials hardcoded inside the app.

**3. To assess resiliency against reverse engineering.**  Apps that implement the software protection measures listed in MASVS-R should be resilient against reverse engineering to a certain degree. In this case, testing the reverse engineering defenses ("resiliency assessment") is part of the overall security test. In the resiliency assessment, the tester assumes the role of the reverse engineer and attempts to bypass the defenses.

In this guide, we'll cover basic tampering techniques such as patching and hooking, as well as common tools and processes for reverse engineering (and comprehending) mobile apps without access to the original source code. Reverse engineering is an immensely complex topic however - covering every possible aspect would easily fill several books. Links and pointers to useful resources are included in the "references" section at the end of each chapter.

### Before You Start

Before you dive into the world of mobile app reversing, we have some good news and some bad news for you. Let's start with the good news:

**Ultimately, the reverse engineer always wins.**

This is even more true in the mobile world, where the reverse engineer has a natural advantage: The way mobile apps are deployed and sandboxed is more restrictive by design, so it is simply not feasible to include the rootkit-like functionality like it is often found in Windows software (e.g. DRM systems). At least on Android, you have a much higher degree of control over the mobile OS, giving you easy wins in many situations (assuming you know how to use that power). On iOS, you get less control - but defensive options are even more limited.

On the other hand, dealing with multi-threaded anti-debugging controls, cryptographic white-boxes, stealthy anti-tampering features and highly complex control flow transformations is not for the faint-hearted.  By nature, the best software protection schemes are highly proprietary, and while many tasks can be automated, the way to successful reversing is plastered with good amounts of thinking, coding, frustration, and - depending on your personality - sleepless nights and strained relationships.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of it in the beginning. The best way to get started is to set up some basic tools (see the respective sections in the Android and iOS reversing chapters) and starting doing simple reversing tasks and crackmes. As you go, you'll need to learn about the assembler/bytecode language, the operating system in question, obfuscations you encounter, and so on. Start with simple tasks and gradually level up to more difficult ones.

### Basic Tampering Techniques

Tampering is the process of making changes to a mobile app (either the compiled app, or the running process) or its environment to affect its behavior. For example, an app might refuse to run on your rooted test device, making it impossible to run some of your tests. In cases like that, you'll want to alter that particular behavior.

In the following section we'll give a high level overview of the techniques most commonly used in mobile app security testing. Later, we'll drill down into OS-specific details for both Android and iOS.

#### Binary Patching

Patching means making changes to the compiled app - e.g. changing code in a binary executable file(s), modifying Java bytecode, or tampering with resources. Patches can be applied in any number of ways, from decompiling, editing and re-assembling an app, to editing binary files in a hex editor - anything goes (this rule applies to all of reverse engineering). We'll give some detailed examples for useful patches in later chapters.

One thing to keep in mind is that modern mobile OSes strictly enforce code signing, so running modified apps is not as straightforward as it used to be in traditional Desktop environments. Yep, security experts had a much easier life in the 90s! Fortunately, this is not all that difficult to do if you work on your own device - it simply means that you need to re-sign the app, or disable the default code signature verification facilities to run modified code.

#### Runtime Tampering

Code injection is a very powerful technique that allows you to explore and modify processes during runtime. The injection process can be implemented in various ways*, but you'll get by without knowing all the details thanks to freely available, well-documented tools that automate it. These tools give you direct access to process memory and important structures such as live objects instantiated by the app, and come with many useful utility functions for resolving loaded libraries, hooking methods and native functions, and more. Tampering with process memory is more difficult to detect than patching files, making in the preferred method in the majority of cases.

Substrate, Frida and XPosed are the most widely used hooking & code injection frameworks in the mobile reversing world. The three frameworks differ in design philosophy and implementation details: Substrate and Xposed focus on code injection and/or hooking, while Frida aims to be a full-blown "dynamic instrumentation framework" that incorporates both code injection and language bindings, as well as an injectable JavaScript VM and console. However, you can also instrument apps with Substrate by using it to inject Cycript, the programming environment (a.k.a. "Cycript-to-JavaScript" compiler) authored by Saurik of Cydia fame. To complicate things even more, Frida's authors also created a fork of Cycript named ["frida-cycript"](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-cycript) that replaces Cycript's runtime with a Frida-based runtime called Mjølner. This enables Cycript to run on all the platforms and architectures maintained by frida-core (if you are confused now don't worry, it's perfectly OK to be). The release was accompanied by a blog post by Frida's developer Ole titled "Cycript on Steroids", which [did not go that down that well with Saurik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/50uweq/cycript_on_steroids_pumping_up_portability_and/).

We'll include some examples for all three frameworks. For your first pick, it's probably best to start with Frida, as it is the most versatile of the three (for this reason we'll also include a bit more details on Frida). Notably, Frida can inject a Javascript VM into process on both Android and iOS, while Cycript injection with Substrate only works on iOS. Ultimately however, you can achieve many of the same end goals with either framework.

##### Dynamic Instrumentation

Code injection can be achieved in different ways. For example, Xposed makes some permanent modifications to the Android app loader that provide hooks to run your own code every time a new process is started. In contrast, Frida achieves code injection by writing code directly into process memory. The process is outlined in a bit more detail below.

When you "attach" Frida to a running app, it uses ptrace to hijack a thread in a running process. This thread is used to allocate a chunk of memory and populate it with a mini-bootstrapper. The bootstrapper starts a fresh thread, connects to the Frida debugging server running on the device, and loads a dynamically generated library file containing the Frida agent and instrumentation code. The original, hijacked thread is restored to its original state and resumed, and execution of the process continues as usual.

Frida injects a complete JavaScript runtime into the process, along with a powerful API that provides a wealth of useful functionality, including calling and hooking of native functions and injecting structured data into memory. It also supports interaction with the Android Java runtime, such as interacting with objects inside the VM.

### Static and Dynamic Binary Analysis

Reverse engineering is the process of reconstructing the semantics of the original source code from a compiled program. In other words, you take the program apart, run it, simulate parts of it, and do other unspeakable things to it, in order to understand what exactly it is doing and how.

#### Using Disassemblers and Decompilers

Disassemblers and decompilers allow you to translate an app's binary code or byte-code back into a more or less understandable format. In the case of native binaries, you'll usually obtain assembler code matching the architecture which the app was compiled for. Android Java apps can be disassembled to Smali (an Assembler language for the dex format), and also quite easily decompiled back to Java code.

A wide range of tools and frameworks is available: From expensive, but convenient GUI tools, to open source disassembler engines and reverse engineering frameworks. Advanced usage instructions for any of these tools often easily fill a book on their own. We'll introduce some of the most widely used disassemblers in the following section. The best way to get started is simply pick the tool that fits your needs and budget and buy a well-reviewed user guide along with it (some recommendations are listed below).

TODO: introduce a few standard tools, IDA Pro, Hopper, Radare2, JEB (?)

TODO: Talk about IDA Scripting and the many plugins developed by the community

#### Debugging

#### Execution Tracing

### Advanced Techniques

For more complicated tasks, such as de-obfuscating heavily obfuscated binaries, you won't get far without automating certain parts of the analysis. For example, understanding and simplifying a complex control flow graph manually in the disassembler would take you years (and most likely drive you mad, way before you're done). Instead, you can augment your workflow with custom made scripts or tools. Fortunately, modern disassemblers come with scripting and extension APIs, and many useful extensions are available for popular ones. Additionally, open-source disassembler engines and binary analysis frameworks exist to make your life easier.

Like always in hacking, the anything-goes-rule applies: Simply use whatever brings you closer to your goal most efficiently. Every binary is different, and every reverse engineer has their own style. Often, the best way to get to the goal is to combine different approaches, such as emulator-based tracing and symbolic execution, to fit the task at hand. To get started, pick a good disassembler and/or reverse engineering framework and start using them to get comfortable with their particular features and extension APIs. Ultimately, the best way to get better is getting hands-on experience.

(... TODO ...)

#### Dynamic Binary Instrumentation

Another useful method for dealing with native binaries is dynamic binary instrumentations (DBI). Instrumentation frameworks such as Valgrind and PIN support fine-grained instruction-level tracing of single processes. This is achieved by inserting dynamically generated code at runtime. Valgrind compiles fine on Android, and pre-built binaries are available for download. The [Valgrind README](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dist.readme-android.html) contains specific compilation instructions for Android.

#### Emulation-based Dynamic Analysis

Running an app in the emulator gives you powerful ways to monitor and manipulate its environment. For some reverse engineering tasks, especially those that require low-level instruction tracing, emulation is the best (or only) choice.

(... TODO ...)

#### Program Analysis Using Symbolic / Concolic Execution

TODO: Introduce RE frameworks

In the late 2000s, symbolic-execution based testing has gained popularity as a means of identifying security vulnerabilities. Symbolic "execution" actually refers to the process of representing possible paths through a program as formulas in first-order logic, whereby variables are represented by symbolic values, which are actually entire ranges of values. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are used to check satisfiability of those formulas and provide a solution, including concrete values for the variables needed to reach a certain point of execution on the path corresponding to the solved formula.

Typically, this approach is used in combination with other techniques such as dynamic execution (hence the name concolic stems from *conc*rete and symb*olic*), in order to tone down the path explosion problem specific to classical symbolic execution. This together with improved SMT solvers and current hardware speeds, allow concolic execution to explore paths in medium size software modules (i.e. in the order of 10s KLOC). However, it also comes in handy for supporting de-obfuscation tasks, such as simplifying control flow graphs. For example, Jonathan Salwan and Romain Thomas have shown how to reverse engineer VM-based software protections using Dynamic Symbolic Execution (i.e., using a mix of actual execution traces, simulation and symbolic execution) [1].

In the Android section, you'll find a walkthrough for cracking a simple license check in an Android application using symbolic execution.

## Assessing the Effectiveness of Anti-Tampering and Obfuscation

In practice, you'll find that many mobile apps implement defenses aiming to make reverse engineering and tampering more difficult. There are several reason why the developers choose to do this: For example, the intention could be to add some protection to locally saved data, to make it more difficult to steal the source code and IP, or to prevent users from tampering with the behaviour of the app. As a security tester, being asked to give an assessment of the effectiveness of such defenses is becoming more and more common.

A sizable percentage of security experts will immediately interject: "But reverse engineering defenses can be bypassed! They don't add anything but security-by-obscurity!". And they're right: Ultimately, software-based defenses can always be defeated, and they should **never** be used in place of solid security controls. The point of this kind of defenses is indeed to add certain amount of obscurity - just enough to deter some groups of adversaries from attaining a particular goal. Your task as a security tester is to answer the question whether a given set of defenses is sufficient to achieve this, while leaving your ideology at the doorstep.

Mobile software anti-reversing schemes are all made from the same building blocks. On the one hand, apps implement defenses against debuggers, tamper proofing of application files and memory, and verifying the integrity of the environment. On the other hand obfuscation is employed to make code and data incomprehensible. How can you verify that a given set of defenses (as a whole) is "good enough" to provide an appropriate level of protection? As it turns out, this is not an easy question to answer.

First of all, there is no one-size-fits-all. Client-side protections are desirable in some cases, but are unnecessary, or even counter-productive, in others. In the worst case, software protections lead to a false sense of security and encourage bad programming practices, such as implementing security controls on the client that would better be located on the server. It is impossible to provide a generic set of resiliency controls that "just works" in every possible case. For this reason, proper modeling of client-side threats is a necessary prerequisite before any form of software protections are implemented.

Effective anti-reversing schemes combine a variety of tampering defenses and obfuscating transformations. Note that in the majority of cases, applying basic measures such as symbol stripping and root detection is sufficient.

### Resiliency Testing Approach

Resiliency testing can be performed in the context of a regular mobile app security test, or stand-alone to verify the effectiveness of a software protection scheme. The process contains of the following high-level steps:

1. Assess whether a suitable and reasonable threat model exists, and the anti-reversing controls fit the threat model;
2. Assess the effectiveness of the defenses in countering using hybrid static/dynamic analysis.

#### Software Protections Model and Taxonomy

We classify reverse engineering defenses into two categories: Tampering defenses and obfuscation. Both types of defenses are used in tandem to achieve resiliency. The following section contains an overview of the taxonomy used in the guide.

##### 1. Tampering Defenses

*Tampering Defenses* are programmatic functions that prevent, or react to, actions of the reverse engineer. For example, an app could terminate when it suspects being run in an emulator, or change its behavior in some way a debugger is attached. They can be further categorized into two modi operandi:

1. Preventive: Functions that aim to prevent likely actions of the reverse engineer. As an example, an app may an operating system API to prevent debuggers from attaching to the process.

2. Reactive: Features that aim to detect, and respond to, tools or actions of the reverse engineer. For example, an app could terminate when it suspects being run in an emulator, or change its behavior in some way a debugger is attached.

Tampering defenses aim to hinder various processes used by reverse engineers, which we have grouped into 5 categories (Figure 2).

![Reverse engineering processes](/Document/Images/Chapters/0x07b/reversing-processes.png "Reverse engineering processes")

##### 2. Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of transforming code and data in ways that make it more difficult to comprehend, while preserving its original meaning or function. The simplest way of making code less comprehensible is stripping information that is meaningful to humans, such as function and variable names. A standard implementation of a cryptographic primitive can be replaced by a network of key-dependent lookup tables so the regular cryptographic key is not exposed in memory ("white-box cryptography"). Code can be into a secret byte-code language that is then run on an interpreter ("virtualization"). There's unlimited ways of encoding and transforming code and data!

Things become complicated when it comes to pinpointing an exact academical definition. In an often cited paper, Barak et. al describe the black-box model of obfuscation. The black-box model considers a program P’ obfuscated if any property that can be learned from P′ can also be obtained by a simulator with only oracle access to P. In other words, P’ does not reveal anything except its input-output behavior. The authors also show that obfuscation is impossible given their own definition by constructing an un-obfuscatable family of programs (8).

Does this mean that obfuscation is impossible? Well, it depends on what we obfuscate and how we define obfuscation. Barack’s result only shows that *some* programs cannot be obfuscated, if we use a very strong definition of obfuscation. Intuitively, most of us know from experience that code can have differing amounts of intelligibility and that understanding the code becomes harder as code complexity increases. Often enough, this happens unintentionally, but we can also observe that implementations of obfuscators exist and are more or less successfully used in practice (9).

Often enough, this happens unintentionally, but we can also observe that implementations of obfuscators exist and are more or less successfully used in practice (9).

*Obfuscating transformations* are modifications applied during the build process to the source code, binary, intermediate representation of the code, or other elements such as data or executable headers. We categorize them into two types:

1. Strip information
2. Obfuscate control flow and data

###### 1. Strip Meaningful Information

Compiled programs often retain explanative information that is helpful for the reverse engineer, but isn’t actually needed for the program to run. Debugging symbols that map machine code or byte code to line numbers, function names and variable names are an obvious example.

For instance, class files generated with the standard Java compiler include the names of classes, methods and fields, making it trivial to reconstruct the source code. ELF and Mach-O binaries have a symbol table that contains debugging information, including the names of functions, global variables and types used in the executable.

Stripping this information makes a compiled program less intelligible while fully preserving its functionality. Possible methods include removing tables with debugging symbols, or renaming functions and variables to random character combinations instead of meaningful names. This process sometimes reduces the size of the compiled program and doesn’t affect its runtime behavior.

###### 2. Obfuscate Control Flow and Data

Program code and data can be obfuscated in unlimited ways - and indeed, there is a rich body of informal and academic research dedicated to it.

An obfuscation scheme is effective if:

1. Robust transformations are applied appropriately to the code and/or data;
2. A sufficient increase in program complexity is achieved so that manual analysis becomes infeasible;
3. The transformations used are resilient against state-of-the-art de-obfuscation techniques.

Different types of obfuscating transformations vary in their impact on program complexity. The spectrum goes from simple *tricks*, such as packing and encryption of large code blocks and manipulations of executable headers, to more intricate forms of obfuscation like just-in-time compilation and virtualization that add significant complexity to parts of the code, data and execution trace.

**Packing and Encryption**

Simple transformations with little impact on program complexity can be used to defeat standard static analysis tools without causing too much size and performance penalties. The execution trace of the obfuscated function(s) remains more or less unchanged. De-obfuscation is relatively trivial, and can be accomplished with standard tools without scripting or customization.

**Transforming Code and/or Data**

Advanced methods aim to hide the semantics of a computation by computing the same function in a more complicated way, or encoding code and data in ways that are not easily comprehensible. Transformations in this category have the following properties:

- The size and performance penalty can be sizable (scales with the obfuscation settings)
- De-obfuscation requires advanced methods and/or custom tools

A simple example for this kind of obfuscations are opaque predicates. Opaque predicates are redundant code branches added to the program that always execute the same way, which is known a priori to the programmer but not to the analyzer. For example, a statement such as if (1 + 1) = 1 always evaluates to false, and thus always result in a jump to the same location. Opaque predicates can be constructed in ways that make them difficult to identify and remove in static analysis.

Some types of obfuscation that fall into this category are:

- Pattern-based obfuscation, when instructions are replaced with more complicated instruction sequences
- Control flow obfuscation
- Control flow flattening
- Function Inlining
- Data encoding and reordering
- Variable splitting
- Virtualization
- White-box cryptography

#### Assessing the Quality of Tampering Defenses

For real-world apps, automated static/dynamic analysis is insufficient to prove security of a program. Manual verification by an experienced tester is still the only reliable way to achieve security.

## Considerations

### Eliminating False Positives

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

A typical reflected XSS attack is executed by sending a URL to the victim(s), which for example can contain a payload to connect to some exploitation framework like BeeF [2]. When clicking on it a reverse tunnel is established with the Beef server in order to attack the victim(s). As a WebView is only a slim browser it is not possible for a user to insert a URL into a WebView of an App as no adress bar is available. Also clicking on a link will not open the URL in a WebView of an App, instead it will open directly within the browser of Android. Therefore a typical reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack that targets a WebView in an App is not applicable and will not work.

If an attacker finds a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in an endpoint, or manages to get a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) position and injects JavaScript into the response, then the exploit will be sent back within the response. The attack will then be executed directly within the WebView. This can become dangerous in case:

* JavaScript is not deactivated in the WebView (see OMTG-ENV-005)
* File access is not deactivated in the WebView (see OMTG-ENV-006)
* The function addJavascriptInterface() is used (see OMTG-ENV-008)

As a summary reflected XSS is no concern for a mobile App, but stored XSS or injected JavaScript through MITM can become a dangerous vulnerability if the WebView in use is configured insecurely.

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The same problem described with reflected XSS also applied to CSRF attacks. A typical CSRF attack is executed by sending a URL to the victim(s) that contains a state changing request like creation of a user account of triggering a financial transaction. As a WebView is only a slim browser it is not possible for a user to insert a URL into a WebView of an App and also clicking on a link will not open the URL in a WebView of an App. Instead it will open directly within the browser of Android. Therefore a typical CSRF attack that targets a WebView in an App is not applicable.

The basis for CSRF attacks, access to session cookies of all browser tabs and attaching them automatically if a request to a web page is executed is not applicable on mobile platforms. This is the default behaviour of full blown browsers. Every App has due to the sandboxing it's own web cache and stores it's own cookies, if WebViews are used. Therefore a CSRF attack against a mobile App is by design not possible as the session cookies are not shared with the Android browser.

Only if a user logs in by using the Android browser (instead of using the mobile App) a CSRF attack would be possible, as then the session cookies are accessible for the browser instance.
